# Run Gensyn `codeassist` on a VPS (with Port Forwarding)

This guide explains how to install and run **Gensyn CodeAssist** on a VPS, especially when you’re running both a **Gensyn Node** and **CodeAssist** on the same server.  
It also covers how to access the CodeAssist web UI from your local machine (WSL) using **SSH port forwarding**.

---

## 🚀 Steps to Setup

### **Step 1 — Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/codeassist
```

---

### **Step 2 — Install UV (Astral Runtime)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

---

### **Step 3 — Reload Your Shell**
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
> If you’re using Zsh, run `source ~/.zshrc` instead.

---

### **Step 4 — Enter the Project Directory**
```bash
cd codeassist
```

---

### **Step 5 — Change Ports (For VPS Users Running Both Gensyn Node & CodeAssist)**

If your VPS already has a **Gensyn Node** running on port `3000`, you need to change CodeAssist’s external port to avoid conflicts.

#### **Edit the Docker Compose file**
```bash
nano compose.yml
```

Find this line:
```yaml
ports:
  - "3000:3000"
```

Change it to:
```yaml
ports:
  - "3001:3000"
```

Save and exit (`Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl + X`).

---

#### **Edit the `run.py` File**
```bash
nano run.py
```

Scroll until you find where the **web UI port** is defined.  
Change the port from `3000` → `3001`.

Example:
```python
# before
uv.run("app:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=3000)

# after
uv.run("app:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=3001)
```

Save and exit.

---

### **Step 6 — Run the Application**
```bash
uv run run.py
```

When prompted for your **Hugging Face token**:
- Paste it using **Ctrl + V** (it won’t appear on screen).
- Press **Enter**.

---

### **Step 7 — Forward Ports from VPS to Your Local Machine (WSL)**

Since you can’t directly open `localhost` on the VPS, forward the required ports to your local machine.

Run this **on your local WSL terminal** (replace with your VPS username and IP):

```bash
ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 \
    -L 8000:localhost:8000 \
    -L 8001:localhost:8001 \
    -L 8008:localhost:8008 \
    username@your_vps_ip
```

- `3001` is for CodeAssist’s web UI.  
- `8000`, `8001`, `8008` are optional — useful for other services like Gensyn Node.

If your VPS is linked with a public SSH key, it may simply ask for confirmation (`yes`) and your password.

---

### **🔑 Alternative Method — Setup SSH Key Authentication (Recommended)**

If you want to avoid entering your VPS password each time or enable SSH forwarding securely, follow these steps to set up an SSH key:

#### **Step 1 — Generate an SSH key on your local machine (WSL)**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "batman"
```

> You can replace `"batman"` with any name or comment you like.  
> When asked for a passphrase, just press **Enter** three times (no need to set one).

---

#### **Step 2 — Display your public key**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the entire output — this is your **public SSH key**.

---

#### **Step 3 — Add your SSH key to the VPS**

Now, you need to paste this key into your VPS so it recognizes your local machine.

If your VPS hosting provider **doesn’t allow adding SSH keys after setup**, you can still do it manually using the VPS console (VNC portal).  

In your VPS terminal, run:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Paste your copied key inside this file.  
To save it:
```
Ctrl + O → Enter → Ctrl + X
```

---

> ⚠️ Some VPS providers like **Serverica** don’t allow SSH keys to be added later through the dashboard, so you must use the **VNC console** method to add the key manually as shown above.  
> Once added, you can connect directly without typing your password each time.

---

#### **Step 4 — Now connect using your SSH key**
Once your key is added to the VPS, use the same SSH forwarding command:

```bash
ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 \
    -L 8000:localhost:8000 \
    -L 8001:localhost:8001 \
    -L 8008:localhost:8008 \
    username@your_vps_ip
```

Now it will connect automatically (no password needed).

---

### **Step 8 — Access CodeAssist in Your Browser**

Once the tunnel is active, open this in your local browser:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

A link will also appear in the terminal — click it.  
Log in with your email when prompted, and you’re ready to use CodeAssist!

## ✅ Example Summary

**Final `compose.yml` snippet:**
```yaml
services:
  codeassist:
    image: gensyn/codeassist:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
    environment:
      - HF_TOKEN=${HF_TOKEN}
```

**Example SSH Command (single line):**
```bash
ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 -L 8000:localhost:8000 -L 8001:localhost:8001 -L 8008:localhost:8008 username@your_vps_ip
```

## 🧠 Notes & Tips

- When pasting the Hugging Face token, it will not appear — that’s normal.
- Keep the SSH terminal open while using CodeAssist (the tunnel closes if you close it).
- If port `3001` is already in use, choose another (e.g., `3002`) and update both files.
- Local users (non-VPS): skip SSH forwarding and open `http://localhost:3000` directly.
- For safety, do **not** expose CodeAssist ports publicly — use SSH tunneling.
- Using SSH keys saves time and increases security for future connections.
